# download-canvas-files
Example using the Canvas API to download files, including directory structure and Canvas Modules.

## Motivation
MIT OpenCourseWare freely publishes teaching materials to https://ocw.mit.edu. OCW has recently launched a new platform that streamlines publishing through a number of technology integrations, for example, utlizing Google Drive as the backend for content authors. OCW authors collect materials from faculty and instruction platforms across MIT and routinely need to share, collaborate, and modify materials before publishing to the web.

The Canvas LMS was introduced in 2020, and given Canvas has a robust set of APIs that allow programmatic access to teaching materials, it is worthwhile exploring how we can more easily transfer content from Canvas to OCW. Programmatically collecting teaching materials for OCW course authors would greatly reduce the overall time required to collect these materials, as well as, offer opportunities to programmatically explore materials before deciding to publish a course.

## API and CanvasAPI
Canvas has well established APIs for interacting with content and metadata. There are a number of third-party python packages supporting programmatic access to content and they are working on ways to make enhance access (e.g., GraphQL).

## What does this repo do?
The goal of this repo/script is to highlight how we can collect teaching materials from Canvas courses and sync them with the OCW publishing platform. This amounts to download files from a course and depositing them into a specific Google Drive folder.

Third-party python package used in this repo: https://canvasapi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting-started.html

### Assumptions
- You have access to a Canvas course and can [generate an API token](https://learninganalytics.ubc.ca/for-students/canvas-api/) from their settings menu.
- You have Google Drive installed locally on their machine, allowing for an automated sync to the Google Drive cloud.
  - One can also use this repo/script to simply download locally.
- You have python3 and can install requirements.

### Running the downloader
Set your .env variables.

`LOCAL_DOWNLOAD_DIR = ~/Desktop/example_course/`, directory where files will be download, e.g., local Google Drive folder (which syncs automatically).

`CANVAS_API_URL="https://institution.test.instructure.com/"`,  org/institutional url of the Canvas instance.

`CANVAS_API_KEY"<you-api-key-retrieved-from-the-canvas-interface>"`,  API key generated through the Canvas settings interface.

`CANVAS_EXAMPLE_COURSE_NUMBER=11111`,  the course number found in a Canvas URL (e.g., https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/2066466). 

To run the downloader:

`python downloader.py`
